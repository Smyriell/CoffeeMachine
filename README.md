Programming a coffee machine simulator

This is my first project on Java.

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, water, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. We can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money. Also, it has a functionality of refilling ingridients.
